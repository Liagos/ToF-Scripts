# ToF-Scripts

Here we provide the Matlab code we use to import and process the data acquired by the Time-Of-Flight sensor. For this reason, we use the script Box2_V_1_5.m. 
The helper functions we use are:
 - BBox_World_EdgeBox which is used to shift the points from the edges of the created bounding box onto the the edges of the actual box used for the           calibration
